Below is a breakdown of each:

### `app/`

This is the Next.js **App Router** folder. It contains your pages, layouts, and route-level components.  
For example:

- `app/page.tsx` — The root page (index) of your application  
- `app/...` — Other route folders and files (e.g. `app/about`, `app/dashboard`, etc.)  
- `app/layout.tsx` — The root layout that wraps all pages  
- Optionally, `app/loading.tsx` or `app/error.tsx` for loading/error UI  

### `components/`

Reusable UI components go here — e.g.:

- Buttons, cards, modals, headers, footers, etc.  
- Larger composed components (e.g. a navbar, sidebar, or hero section)  

### `lib/`

Library / helper modules, such as:

- API clients  
- Data fetching utilities  
- Configuration helpers  
- Abstractions over external services  

### `public/`

Static assets served at root (public) path. Examples:

- Images (logos, icons)  
- Fonts  
- Favicon  
- Any other static files you want to serve  

You can reference them like `/logo.png`, etc. in your code.

### `types/`

TypeScript type definitions, interfaces, and global types:

- Shared domain models  
- Prop types  
- Utility types  
- External API response types  

### `utils/`

Utility functions and helpers used across the app, e.g.:

- String formatting  
- Date/time helpers  
- Validation functions  
- Other pure helper modules  

### Root-level files

- `.gitignore` — Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control  
- `components.json` — (custom config / mapping for components)  
- `next.config.ts` — Next.js configuration  
- `package.json` — Project dependencies and scripts  
- `postcss.config.mjs` — PostCSS (if used) config  
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration
